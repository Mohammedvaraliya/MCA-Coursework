It starts with the second element and compares it with the elements before it, inserting it into its appropriate position. This process is repeated for all elements, resulting in a sorted list.\n","\n","1. **Working**:\n","    1. Divide the list into a sorted and an unsorted part.\n","    2. Pick each element from the unsorted part and insert it into the correct position in the sorted part.\n","2.
