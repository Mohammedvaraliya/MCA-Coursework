For a left rotation, elements are shifted towards the beginning of the array, and for a right rotation, they are shifted towards the end. The elements that go beyond the array bounds reappear at the other end.\n","\n","Array rotation has multiple applications in data manipulation, cyclic patterns, and algorithms. Python offers both efficient and straightforward methods for performing rotations.\n","\n","### **Algorithm:**\n","\n","1. **Left Rotation by `d` Positions**\n","    1. **Input**: An array `arr` of length `n` and an integer `d` (number of rotations).\n","    2. **Step 1**: Normalize `d` if `d` > `n`, as rotating by `d` is the same as rotating by `d % n`.\n","    3. **Step 2**: Slice the array into two parts:\n","        1.
