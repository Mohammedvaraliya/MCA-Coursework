Heap Sort is a comparison-based sorting technique based on a binary heap data structure. A **binary heap** is a complete binary tree where each node satisfies the heap property:\n","        1. **Max Heap**: Each parent node is greater than or equal to its children.\n","        2. **Min Heap**: Each parent node is less than or equal to its children.\n","    2. We use a Max Heap to sort the array in ascending order. The **Heapify** function is used to maintain the max heap property. In each iteration, the largest element (root) is swapped to the end of the array, and the heap size is reduced, repeating this process to sort the array.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"4pE_KBE6fiws"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### Hereâ€™s the Python implementation for Heap Sort.
