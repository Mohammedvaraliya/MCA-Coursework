This process continues until no swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name because smaller elements \"bubble\" to the top of the list, while larger elements \"sink\" to the end.\n","\n","Each pass through the list places the next largest element in its correct position, making the list more sorted with each iteration. However, due to its high time complexity of $O(n^2)$, Bubble Sort is primarily used for educational purposes or for small datasets where simplicity is more important than efficiency.\n","\n","### Algorithm:\n","\n","Hereâ€™s the algorithm to perform Bubble Sort on a list of `n` elements:\n","\n","1. **Step 1**: Start with the first element and iterate over the list.\n","2. **Step 2**: For each element, compare it with the next element in the list.\n","    1. If the current element is greater than the next element, swap them.\n","3. **Step 3**: Repeat the above steps for all elements in the list. After each full pass, the largest unsorted element is placed in its correct position at the end of the list.\n","4. **Step 4**: Stop the process if a full pass is made with no swaps, indicating the list is sorted."],"metadata":{"id":"X0k1jejafiz0"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def bubble_sort(arr):\n","    n = len(arr)\n","    for i in range(n):\n","        swapped = False\n","        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):\n","            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:\n","                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]\n","                swapped = True\n","        if not swapped:\n","            break"],"metadata":{"id":"_z8YvxJcZuEq","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1730964135378,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":423,"user":{"displayName":"Mohammed Varaliya","userId":"04213318732328182001"}}},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":5,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"zosuufyUZW-e","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1730964135831,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":3,"user":{"displayName":"Mohammed Varaliya","userId":"04213318732328182001"}},"outputId":"0641ee38-05c2-440a-ba1b-0040ca21c363"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Sorted array: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]\n"]}],"source":["arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\n","\n","bubble_sort(arr)\n","print(\"Sorted array:\", arr)"]}]}
