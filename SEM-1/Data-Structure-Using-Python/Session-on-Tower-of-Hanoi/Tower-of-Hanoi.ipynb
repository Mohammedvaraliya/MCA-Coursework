The goal is to move all disks from the source tower to the destination tower with the help of an auxiliary tower, following these rules:\n","\n","1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n","2. A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.\n","3. Only the top disk of a tower can be moved at any time.\n","\n","For \\( n \\) disks, the solution requires moving the disks in a specific sequence.
