Instead of scanning each element sequentially (as in Linear Search), Binary Search narrows down the search range by comparing the target element with the middle element of the current range. If the target is equal to the middle element, the search stops. If it’s smaller, the search continues in the left half; if it’s larger, the search continues in the right half. This approach has a time complexity of \\(O(\\log n)\\), making it much faster than linear search for large datasets.\n","\n","### Algorithm:\n","\n","Binary Search requires the list to be sorted. Here’s the algorithm:\n","\n","1. **Step 1**: Initialize two pointers, `low` to the beginning of the list and `high` to the end.\n","2. **Step 2**: While `low` is less than or equal to `high`:\n","    1. Calculate the middle index `mid = (low + high) // 2`.\n","    2. If the element at `mid` is equal to the target, return `mid` (target found).\n","    3. If the element at `mid` is greater than the target, update `high = mid - 1` to search in the left half.\n","    4. If the element at `mid` is less than the target, update `low = mid + 1` to search in the right half.\n","3. **Step 3**: If the loop completes without finding the target, return -1 to indicate it’s not present in the list."],"metadata":{"id":"3jpbbSKYN0i7"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### Here’s the Python implementation for Binary Search.
