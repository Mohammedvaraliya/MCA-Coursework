The main libraries include:\n","\n","1. **`collections`**: Provides specialized data structures like `deque`, `Counter`, `defaultdict`, `OrderedDict`, `namedtuple`, and `ChainMap`.\n","2. **`array`**: Offers efficient storage for homogenous data types in a compact array format.\n","3. **`heapq`**: Implements a min-heap, useful for priority queues and finding the smallest elements in an iterable.\n","4. **`queue`**: Provides thread-safe queues like `Queue`, `LifoQueue`, and `PriorityQueue` for different queue-based applications.\n","\n","### Algorithm:\n","\n","1. **Import Required Libraries**:\n","    1. Import each library (`collections`, `array`, `heapq`) based on the data structure needed.\n","2. **Initialize and Manipulate Data Structures**:\n","    1. Use `deque` for double-ended queue operations.\n","    2. Use `Counter` to count occurrences of elements.\n","    3. Use `array` for compact storage of homogeneous data.\n","    4. Use `heapq` for priority queue operations.\n","3. **Perform Data Structure Operations**:\n","    1. Perform various operations like adding, removing, and accessing elements using the specific functions provided by each library."],"metadata":{"id":"j5x6Ow4CemL1"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### collections: deque"],"metadata":{"id":"afVcQ8Q8etij"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"JYvCFxA5eiwO","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1730829588621,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1372,"user":{"displayName":"Mohammed Varaliya","userId":"04213318732328182001"}},"outputId":"8909a6a6-5a8c-48ba-dfbc-9b5846860681"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Deque: deque([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])\n"]}],"source":["from collections import deque\n","\n","# Initialize a deque with some initial values\n","d = deque([1, 2, 3])\n","\n","# Add an element to the end of the deque\n","d.append(4)\n","\n","# Add an element to the beginning of the deque\n","d.appendleft(0)\n","\n","# Print the current state of the deque\n","print(\"Deque:\", d)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### collections: Counter"],"metadata":{"id":"amg8bL88fV9a"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from collections import Counter\n","\n","# Count occurrences of each fruit in the list\n","count = Counter(['apple', 'banana', 'apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'apple'])\n","\n","# Print the count of each element\n","print(\"Counter:\", count)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"A_5lU3Q1evhX","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1730829714112,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":608,"user":{"displayName":"Mohammed Varaliya","userId":"04213318732328182001"}},"outputId":"df76d09f-baed-4b85-da14-6a89af12cd1b"},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Counter: Counter({'apple': 3, 'banana': 2, 'orange': 1})\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### array: Creating and Manipulating Arrays"],"metadata":{"id":"hyGE5v_CgFUk"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import array as arr\n","\n","# Create an array of integers with initial values\n","a = arr.array('i', [1, 2, 3, 4])  # 'i' is the typecode for integers\n","\n","# Append an integer to the array\n","a.append(5)\n","\n","# Print the current state of the array\n","print(\"Array:\", a)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"7Ujxq9PrfX0j","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1730829912150,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1074,"user":{"displayName":"Mohammed Varaliya","userId":"04213318732328182001"}},"outputId":"dfc1bb2e-63dc-408e-ffea-ba9a9e388d4d"},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Array: array('i', [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### heapq: Priority Queue (Min-Heap)"],"metadata":{"id":"OU82SkR7gJyE"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import heapq\n","\n","# Initial list to be converted into a heap\n","heap = [5, 3, 2, 8, 1]\n","\n","# Convert the list into a heap (in-place)\n","heapq.heapify(heap)\n","\n","# Add an element to the heap\n","heapq.heappush(heap, 0)\n","\n","# Print the current state of the heap\n","print(\"Heap:\", heap)\n","\n","# Remove the smallest element from the heap\n","smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)\n","\n","# Print the removed smallest element and the updated heap\n","print(\"Smallest element removed:\", smallest)\n","print(\"Heap after pop:\", heap)"],"metadata":{"id":"TbOGp2gmgID_","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1730829926419,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":549,"user":{"displayName":"Mohammed Varaliya","userId":"04213318732328182001"}},"outputId":"1aee2694-76b1-4537-ada4-900b2ef8dae3","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"}},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Heap: [0, 3, 1, 8, 5, 2]\n","Smallest element removed: 0\n","Heap after pop: [1, 3, 2, 8, 5]\n"]}]}]}
