Python provides built-in functions like `max()` and `min()` that simplify this process, but we can also write custom functions to achieve the same result.\n","\n","### **Algorithm:**\n","\n","1. **Using Built-in Functions (`max()` and `min()`)**\n","    1. Start with a list of values.\n","    2. Call the `max()` function to find the maximum value.\n","    3. Call the `min()` function to find the minimum value.\n","    4.

Initialize two variables to hold the maximum and minimum values, starting with the first element of the list.\n","    3. Traverse through each element:\n","        - If an element is greater than the current maximum, update the maximum value.\n","        - If an element is less than the current minimum, update the minimum value.\n","    4.
