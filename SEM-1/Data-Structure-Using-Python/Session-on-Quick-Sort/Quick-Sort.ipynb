Each part is sorted individually through recursive partitioning. There are two main partitioning schemes:\n","\n","1. **Hoare Partition Scheme**\n","    1. **Description**: Hoare Partition uses Two-directional scanning technique that comes from the left until it finds an element that is bigger than the pivot, and from the right until it finds an element that is smaller than the pivot and then swaps the two. The process continues until the scan from the left meets the scan from the right.\n","    2. **Implementation**:\n","        1. Select the first element as the pivot.\n","        2. Move pointers inward, swapping elements until they cross.\n","    3. **Effectiveness**:\n","        1. Generally than Lomuto because it makes fewer swaps and can be more efficient in terms of cache performance.\n","        2. It has better worst-case performance compared to Lomuto (still $O(n^2)$ in worst-case scenarios but performs better in practice).\n","    \n","    ---\n","2. **Lomuto Partition Scheme**\n","    1. **Description**: This method uses a single pivot. Elements are rearranged such that all elements less than or equal to the pivot are on one side and those greater are on the other.\n","    2. **Implementation**:\n","        1. Select the last element as the pivot.\n","        2. Maintain a pointer that tracks the position of the smaller element.\n","        3. Swap elements to ensure that smaller elements are moved to the front.\n","    3. **Effectiveness**:\n","        1. Simplicity of implementation.\n","        2. Performs well on average $\\text{O(n} \\log \\text{n)}$, but can degrade to $O(n^2)$ in the worst case (e.g., already sorted arrays)."],"metadata":{"id":"BQoa3v7yMB4y"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def partition(arr, start, end):\n","    pivot_index = start\n","    pivot = arr[pivot_index]\n","\n","    while start < end:\n","\n","        while start < len(arr) and arr[start] <= pivot:\n","            start += 1\n","\n","        while arr[end] > pivot:\n","            end -= 1\n","\n","        if start < end:\n","            arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[start]\n","\n","    arr[end], arr[pivot_index] = arr[pivot_index], arr[end]\n","\n","    return end"],"metadata":{"id":"LVuEvoXTkjhP","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1731059672644,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":409,"user":{"displayName":"Mohammed Varaliya","userId":"04213318732328182001"}}},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":6,"metadata":{"id":"I-AIi42HkelH","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1731059685559,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":485,"user":{"displayName":"Mohammed Varaliya","userId":"04213318732328182001"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["def quick_sort(arr, start, end):\n","    if len(arr)== 1:\n","        return\n","\n","    if start < end:\n","        partition_index = partition(arr, start, end)\n","        quick_sort(arr, start, partition_index-1)\n","        quick_sort(arr, partition_index+1, end)"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["array1 = [10, 5, 8, 12, 15, 6, 3, 9, 16]\n","print(\"Original array:\", array1)\n","quick_sort(arr = array1, start = 0, end = len(array1) - 1)\n","print(\"Sorted array:\", array1)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"yhPRyDpPmBOX","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1731059694454,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":473,"user":{"displayName":"Mohammed Varaliya","userId":"04213318732328182001"}},"outputId":"54ab8bd3-3044-4dd5-c859-dc01857ce335"},"execution_count":7,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Original array: [10, 5, 8, 12, 15, 6, 3, 9, 16]\n","Sorted array: [3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16]\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["array2 = [56, 61, 54, 64, 59, 53, 58, 56, 52, 60, 51]\n","print(\"Original array:\", array2)\n","quick_sort(arr = array2, start = 0, end = len(array2) - 1)\n","print(\"Sorted array:\", array2)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"4gmAgO0hkl-z","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1731059701401,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":418,"user":{"displayName":"Mohammed Varaliya","userId":"04213318732328182001"}},"outputId":"67732bd5-2ada-4bf2-a4d0-b2d7953f0410"},"execution_count":8,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Original array: [56, 61, 54, 64, 59, 53, 58, 56, 52, 60, 51]\n","Sorted array: [51, 52, 53, 54, 56, 56, 58, 59, 60, 61, 64]\n"]}]}]}
