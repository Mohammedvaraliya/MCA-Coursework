### Problem Statement

Create an HTML page with initial elements and a user interface that allows users to add new HTML elements dynamically. The interface should include dropdowns for selecting the following options:

1. The action (append or prepend).
2. The specific HTML element type (e.g., `<div>`, `<p>`, `<h1>`, etc.).
3. The text content for the selected element.

After user selections, a "Submit" button should perform the chosen operation, adding the new element at the specified location in the existing HTML structure.
