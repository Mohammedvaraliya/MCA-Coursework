### Problem Statement

Create a `div` element inside the `body` tag with appropriate height, width, and color to make it noticeable. Add a `mouseover` event listener to the `div` using the `addEventListener` method. Whenever the user hovers over the `div`, generate a random number and display it below the `div` in the body.

Additionally, place a button below the displayed random number. When the user clicks this button, the `mouseover` event should be removed. After the event is removed, if the user hovers over the `div`, no random numbers should be generated. Instead, display the message "Event has been removed."
