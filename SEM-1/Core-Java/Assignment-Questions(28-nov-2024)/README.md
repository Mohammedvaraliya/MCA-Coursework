1. **Explain constructor, types of constructors and how constructors are being called in Inheritance?**

   1. A **constructor in a java** is a special method used to initialize objects. It has the same name as the class and no return type. Constructors are called automatically when an object is created.
   2. **Types of Constructors**:
      1. **Default Constructor**:
         1. A constructor with no parameters.
         2. If no constructor is defined, Java provides a default constructor.
         3. Initializes object with default values.
         4. **Example:**

            ```java
            class Car {
                public Car() {
                    System.out.println("Car is created!");
                }
            }
            ```
      2. **Parameterized Constructor**:
         1. A constructor that accepts parameters to initialize the object with specific values.
         2. **Example:**

            ```java
            class Car {
                String color;
                public Car(String color) {
                    this.color = color;
                }
            }
            ```
      3. **Copy Constructor**:
         1. A copy constructor is a special type of constructor in Java that creates a new object as a copy of an existing object. It's invoked when an object is initialized with another object of the same class.
         2. **Example:**

            ```java
            public class Person {
                private String name;
                private int age;

                // Parameterized constructor
                public Person(String name, int age) {
                    this.name = name;
                    this.age = age;
                }

                // Copy constructor
                public Person(Person person) {
                    this.name = person.name;
                    this.age = person.age;
                }
            }
            ```
      4. **Constructors in Inheritance**:
         1. When a subclass object is created, the **superclass constructor** is called first.
         2. The **subclass constructor** is called after the superclass constructor is executed.
         3. The superclass constructor is called either automatically (if no constructor is specified) or explicitly using the `super()` keyword.
         4. **Example**:

            ```java
            class Animal {
                Animal() {
                    System.out.println("Animal created");
                }
            }

            class Dog extends Animal {
                Dog() {
                    super();  // Calls the Animal constructor
                    System.out.println("Dog created");
                }
            }

            public class Main {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    Dog dog = new Dog();
                }
            }
            ```

         5. **Output**:

            ```bash
            Animal created
            Dog created
            ```

         6. **Explanation**:
            1. When a `Dog` object is created, the `Animal` constructor is called first (either implicitly or with `super()`), followed by the `Dog` constructor.

      4. **Example:**

         ```java
         Frame frame = new Frame("Sample Window");
         Button button = new Button("Click Me");
         frame.add(button);
         frame.setSize(300, 200);
         frame.setVisible(true);
         ```

3. **Explain any four methods of String Buffer class?**

   1. The **`StringBuffer`** class in Java is used to create mutable (modifiable) strings. It allows for efficient string manipulation, such as appending, inserting, or deleting characters without creating new string objects.
   2. **Four Common Methods of `StringBuffer`:**
      1. **`append(String str)`**:
         1. Adds the specified string to the end of the `StringBuffer`.
         2. **Example**:

            ```java
            StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("Hello");
            sb.append(" World");
            System.out.println(sb);  // Output: Hello World
            ```
      2. **`insert(int offset, String str)`**:
         1. Inserts the specified string at the given position (offset) in the `StringBuffer`.
         2. **Example**:

            ```java
            StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("Hello World");
            sb.insert(6, "Java ");
            System.out.println(sb);  // Output: Hello Java World
            ```
      3. **`delete(int start, int end)`**:
         1. Removes the characters between the specified `start` and `end` positions (end is exclusive).
         2. **Example**:

            ```java
            StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("Hello Java");
            sb.delete(5, 10);
            System.out.println(sb);  // Output: Hello
            ```
      4. **`reverse()`**:
         1. Reverses the characters in the `StringBuffer`.
         2. **Example**:

            ```java
            StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("Hello");
            sb.reverse();
            System.out.println(sb);  // Output: olleH
            ```
   3. These methods allow for easy manipulation of strings without creating new objects every time, making `StringBuffer` more efficient for frequent modifications.

4. **Compare and contrast overloading and overriding methods in java?**

   | **Aspect**                   | **Method Overloading**                                                                                         | **Method Overriding**                                                                            |
   | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | **Definition**               | Defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (different number or type of arguments). | Redefining a method in a subclass that already exists in the superclass with the same signature. |
   | **Method Signature**         | Must be different (parameter type, number, or both).                                                           | Must be the same (same method name, return type, and parameters).                                |
   | **Inheritance**              | Not required. Overloading can occur in the same class.                                                         | Required. Overriding happens in a subclass.                                                      |
   | **Compile-Time or Run-Time** | Compile-time polymorphism (resolved during compilation).                                                       | Run-time polymorphism (resolved at runtime).                                                     |
   | **Return Type**              | Return type can be the same or different.                                                                      | Return type must be the same or a subtype (covariant return type).                               |
   | **Access Modifier**          | Overloaded methods can have different access modifiers.                                                        | Overridden method must have the same or a more permissive access modifier.                       |
   | **Example**                  | `void add(int a, int b)` and `void add(double a, double b)`                                                    | `@Override                                                                                       |

   void display() {
   //logic
   }`
in subclass when`display()` exists in superclass. |

5. **Explain Exception handling mechanisms with an example.**

   1. **Exception Handling** in Java is a mechanism to handle runtime errors, ensuring that the program runs smoothly even when unexpected events (exceptions) occur. It allows the program to catch and handle errors without crashing.
   2. **Key Components of Exception Handling**:
      1. **`try` block**: Contains code that might throw an exception.
      2. **`catch` block**: Catches and handles the exception.
      3. **`finally` block**: Executes code after `try`/`catch`, regardless of whether an exception occurred.
      4. **`throw`**: Used to manually throw an exception.
      5. **`throws`**: Declares exceptions that a method might throw.
   3. **Example**:

      ```java
      public class ExceptionExample {
          public static void main(String[] args) {
              try {
                  int result = 10 / 0;  // Division by zero (throws ArithmeticException)
              } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
                  System.out.println("Error: Cannot divide by zero!");  // Handle the exception
              } finally {
                  System.out.println("This block runs regardless of an exception.");
              }
          }
      }
      ```

   4. **Output**:

      ```bash
      Error: Cannot divide by zero!
      This block runs regardless of an exception.
      ```

   5. **Explanation**:
      1. The `try` block contains code that might cause an exception (division by zero).
      2. The `catch` block catches the `ArithmeticException` and provides a custom message.
      3. The `finally` block runs regardless of whether an exception occurred.

6. **What is Swing? And explain the 3 layouts in swing?.**

   1. **Swing** is a part of Java's **Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT)** and provides a set of GUI components to create graphical user interfaces. Unlike AWT, Swing is platform-independent and provides more flexible and customizable components like buttons, text fields, and panels. It is lightweight, meaning it does not rely on native operating system components, and is part of the `javax.swing` package.
   2. Three Common Layouts in Swing:
      1. **`FlowLayout`**:
         1. **Description**: The components are arranged in a left-to-right flow, one after another. When the row is filled, the next row starts.
         2. **Usage**: Good for simple layouts where elements just flow sequentially.
         3. **Example**:

            ```java
            setLayout(new FlowLayout());
            ```
      2. **`BorderLayout`**:
         1. **Description**: Divides the container into five regions: **North**, **South**, **East**, **West**, and **Center**. Components are placed in one of these regions.
         2. **Usage**: Common for applications with a header, footer, sidebar, and main content area.
         3. **Example**:

            ```java
            setLayout(new BorderLayout());
            add(button1, BorderLayout.NORTH);
            add(button2, BorderLayout.CENTER);
            ```
      3. **`GridLayout`**:
         1. **Description**: Arranges components in a grid with a specified number of rows and columns. Each cell has the same size.
         2. **Usage**: Ideal for creating forms or evenly spaced components.
         3. **Example**:

            ```java
            setLayout(new GridLayout(2, 3));  // 2 rows, 3 columns
            ```

7. **Explain Event handling mechanisms.**

   1. **Event Handling** in Java is a mechanism that allows a program to respond to user actions (like clicking a button, typing in a text field, or moving the mouse). The core idea is to define what should happen when an event occurs.
   2. **Event Handling Mechanism Steps:**
      1. **Event Source**: The component (like a button, text field, or mouse) that generates the event (e.g., a button click).
      2. **Event Listener**: An interface that defines the method(s) that will respond to the event (e.g., `ActionListener` for a button click).
      3. **Event Object**: An object that contains information about the event (e.g., which button was clicked).
      4. **Event Registration**: You register the listener with the event source to listen for the event.
      5. **Event Handling**: When the event occurs, the listener's method gets called and handles the event.
   3. **Example of Event Handling:**

      ```java
      import java.awt.*;
      import java.awt.event.*;

      public class ButtonExample {
          public static void main(String[] args) {
              Frame frame = new Frame("Event Handling Example");
              Button button = new Button("Click Me");

              // Register the event listener
              button.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
                  public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
                      System.out.println("Button clicked!");
                  }
              });

              frame.add(button);
              frame.setSize(300, 200);
              frame.setVisible(true);
          }
      }
      ```

8. **What is `StringTokenizer`? Explain with an example.**

   1. **`StringTokenizer`** is a class in Java used to split a string into tokens (substrings) based on specified delimiters (characters that separate the tokens). It is part of the `java.util` package and can be used to break a string into smaller parts, like words or phrases.
   2. **Key Methods of `StringTokenizer`**:
      1. **`nextToken()`**: Returns the next token in the string.
      2. **`hasMoreTokens()`**: Checks if there are more tokens to retrieve.
   3. **Example**:

      ```java
      import java.util.StringTokenizer;

      public class StringTokenizerExample {
          public static void main(String[] args) {
              String sentence = "Java is powerful, flexible, and easy to learn!";

              // Create StringTokenizer with space as delimiter
              StringTokenizer tokenizer = new StringTokenizer(sentence, " ");

              // Loop through tokens
              while (tokenizer.hasMoreTokens()) {
                  System.out.println(tokenizer.nextToken());
              }
          }
      }
      ```

   4. **Output**:

      ```bash
      Java
      is
      powerful,
      flexible,
      and
      easy
      to
      learn!

      ```

   5. **Explanation**:
      1. The `StringTokenizer` object splits the sentence into tokens based on spaces (`" "`).
      2. Each token is printed out by calling `nextToken()`, which returns the individual words or phrases from the string.
      3. `StringTokenizer` is a simple way to tokenize strings, but it is less powerful than using regular expressions (with `String.split()`), especially for more complex tokenization.

9. **State the significance of ‘static keyword and explain with necessary code how you could access the static variables and static methods of a class.**

   1. The `static` keyword in Java is used to create class-level variables and methods that belong to the class itself, rather than to instances of the class. This means they are shared by all objects of that class, and you can access them without creating an instance of the class.
   2. **Significance of `static`:**
      1. **Static Variables**: These are shared among all instances of a class, meaning all objects access the same variable.
      2. **Static Methods**: These can be called without creating an object of the class, as they belong to the class itself.
   3. **How to access static variables and methods:**
      1. **Static Variables**: Access using the class name.
      2. **Static Methods**: Call directly using the class name, no object needed.
   4. **Example:**

      ```java
      class MyClass {
          static int counter = 0;  // Static variable

          static void displayCounter() {  // Static method
              System.out.println("Counter: " + counter);
          }
      }

      public class Main {
          public static void main(String[] args) {
              // Access static variable and method directly using the class name
              MyClass.counter = 10;  // Set static variable
              MyClass.displayCounter();  // Call static method
          }
      }
      ```

   5. **Explanation:**
      1. The static variable `counter` is accessed using `MyClass.counter`.
      2. The static method `displayCounter()` is called using `MyClass.displayCounter()`.
      3. Both the static variable and method belong to the class itself, so no object of `MyClass` is needed.

10. **What are the unique features of ‘Border layout’?**

    1. **Border Layout** is a layout manager in Java used for organizing components in five distinct regions: **North**, **South**, **East**, **West**, and **Center**.
    2. **Unique Features:**
       1. **Five Regions**: Components are arranged in **North**, **South**, **East**, **West**, and **Center**.
       2. **Center takes most space**: The **Center** region takes up all remaining space after placing components in the other regions.
       3. **Resizable**: Components in the North, South, East, and West regions resize with the window, but the **Center** region adapts to the available space.
    3. **Example:**

       ```java
       import java.awt.*;
       import javax.swing.*;

       public class BorderLayoutExample {
           public static void main(String[] args) {
               JFrame frame = new JFrame("Border Layout Example");
               frame.setLayout(new BorderLayout());

               frame.add(new JButton("North"), BorderLayout.NORTH);
               frame.add(new JButton("South"), BorderLayout.SOUTH);
               frame.add(new JButton("East"), BorderLayout.EAST);
               frame.add(new JButton("West"), BorderLayout.WEST);
               frame.add(new JButton("Center"), BorderLayout.CENTER);

               frame.setSize(400, 400);
               frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
               frame.setVisible(true);
           }
       }
       ```

    4. **Explanation:**
       1. **North**, **South**, **East**, **West**, and **Center** are specified using `BorderLayout.NORTH`, `BorderLayout.SOUTH`, etc.
       2. The **Center** fills the remaining space and resizes dynamically.

11. **Which methods are useful in effecting inter-thread communication? Discuss them in detail.**

    1. In Java, **inter-thread communication** allows threads to communicate with each other, typically for synchronization purposes. The primary methods used for inter-thread communication are:
    2. **`wait()`**:

       1. **Purpose**: Makes the current thread release the lock and enter the waiting state until it's notified.
       2. **Usage**: Called on an object (usually inside a synchronized block/method).
       3. **Example**: A thread waits for a signal to resume execution.

       ```java
       synchronized (obj) {
           while (condition is false) {
               obj.wait();  // Thread waits until notified
           }
       }
       ```

    3. **`notify()`**:
       1. **Purpose**: Wakes up one thread that is waiting on the object's monitor (lock).
       2. **Usage**: Used to signal a waiting thread to resume.
       3. **Example:**

          ```java
          synchronized (obj) {
              obj.notify();  // Wakes up one waiting thread
          }
          ```
    4. **`notifyAll()`**:
       1. **Purpose**: Wakes up all threads that are waiting on the object's monitor (lock).
       2. **Usage**: Used when you want to signal all waiting threads to check the condition.
       3. **Example:**

          ```java
          synchronized (obj) {
              obj.notifyAll();  // Wakes up all waiting threads
          }
          ```
    5. **Example:**

       ```java
       class SharedResource {
           private int counter = 0;

           synchronized void increment() {
               counter++;
               notify();  // Notify any waiting thread
           }

           synchronized void waitForValue(int value) throws InterruptedException {
               while (counter < value) {
                   wait();  // Wait until counter reaches the value
               }
           }
       }

       public class ThreadCommunicationExample {
           public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
               SharedResource sharedResource = new SharedResource();

               // Thread 1: Wait until counter reaches 5
               Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
                   try {
                       sharedResource.waitForValue(5);
                       System.out.println("Counter reached 5!");
                   } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                       e.printStackTrace();
                   }
               });

               // Thread 2: Increment counter
               Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
                   for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                       sharedResource.increment();
                       System.out.println("Incremented: " + i);
                   }
               });

               t1.start();
               t2.start();

               t1.join();
               t2.join();
           }
       }
       ```

    6. **Explanation:**
       1. `wait()` is used in `waitForValue()` to make Thread 1 wait until the counter reaches a specific value.
       2. `notify()` is used in `increment()` to wake up Thread 1 once the counter is incremented.
       3. These methods help achieve **synchronization** and **cooperation** between threads.

12. **What do you mean by synchronization? With an example state why do we need it?**

    1. **Synchronization** in Java is a mechanism to ensure that only one thread can access a shared resource (like a variable or object) at a time. This helps prevent **data inconsistency** or **race conditions** when multiple threads try to modify shared resources simultaneously.
    2. **Why do we need synchronization?**
       1. Without synchronization, multiple threads can interfere with each other while accessing or modifying shared data, leading to unpredictable behavior.
    3. **Example:**

       ```java
       class Counter {
           private int count = 0;

           // Synchronized method to ensure thread safety
           synchronized void increment() {
               count++;
           }

           synchronized int getCount() {
               return count;
           }
       }

       public class SyncExample {
           public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
               Counter counter = new Counter();

               // Thread 1: Increment the counter 1000 times
               Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
                   for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                       counter.increment();
                   }
               });

               // Thread 2: Increment the counter 1000 times
               Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
                   for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                       counter.increment();
                   }
               });

               t1.start();
               t2.start();

               t1.join();
               t2.join();

               System.out.println("Final count: " + counter.getCount()); // Expected: 2000
           }
       }
       ```

    4. **Explanation:**
       1. Without synchronization, the counter could be incorrectly updated by both threads at the same time, leading to inconsistent results.
       2. The `synchronized` keyword ensures that only one thread accesses the `increment()` method at a time, providing correct and consistent updates to the `count`.
