# Business Statistics

**Objectives:**

This subject is designed to provide students with an in-depth understanding of descriptive and inferential statistics. The subject will give them an overview of many applications of the two statistics. Management students are oriented towards organizing, presenting, analyzing and summarizing the data in an informative way, which helps them in decision-making. While, the knowledge of inferential statistics facilitates them to draw conclusions about population characteristics on the basis of a sample study.
