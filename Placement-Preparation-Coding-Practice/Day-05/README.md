# Leetcode Questions Solved on Day 4 Placement Training:

1. **Missing Number**
2. **Rotate Array**

## 01. Missing Number

[LeetCode Problem URL](https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/)

Given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers in the range `[0, n]`, return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

```bash
Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation:
n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
```

```bash
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation:
n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
```

```bash
Example 3:

Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
Explanation:
n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
```

## 02. Rotate Array

[LeetCode Problem URL](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/)

Given an integer array `nums`, rotate the array to the right by `k` steps, where `k` is non-negative.

```bash
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
```

```bash
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
```
