## 🧩 Problem Explanation

You're given a **6×6 matrix** filled with letters and numbers:

```
A B C D E F
G H I J K L
M N O P Q R
S T U V W X
Y Z 1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8 9 0
```

### 🎯 Goal:

Write a program that:

- Takes an **alphanumeric string** as input (e.g., `"OWL"` or `"LANG27"`).
- Starts from `'A'` (top-left corner of the matrix).
- Moves through the matrix to reach each character in the input string.
- Counts the **minimum number of steps** needed to reach all characters in order.

### 🧭 Movement Rules:

- You can move **up, down, left, or right**.
- Each move counts as **1 step**.
- Diagonal moves are **not allowed**.

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Solution

### ✅ Step 1: Represent the Matrix

Create a 2D array to store the matrix:

```python
matrix = [
    ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F'],
    ['G', 'H', 'I', 'J', 'K', 'L'],
    ['M', 'N', 'O', 'P', 'Q', 'R'],
    ['S', 'T', 'U', 'V', 'W', 'X'],
    ['Y', 'Z', '1', '2', '3', '4'],
    ['5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '0']
]
```

---

### ✅ Step 2: Find Position of a Character

Create a function to find where a character is in the matrix:

```python
def find_position(char):
    for i in range(6):
        for j in range(6):
            if matrix[i][j] == char:
                return (i, j)
```

---

### ✅ Step 3: Calculate Steps Between Two Characters

Use Manhattan distance (since only up/down/left/right moves are allowed):

```python
def steps_between(pos1, pos2):
    return abs(pos1[0] - pos2[0]) + abs(pos1[1] - pos2[1])
```

---

### ✅ Step 4: Traverse the Input String

Loop through each character and add up the steps:

```python
def calculate_steps(input_string):
    total_steps = 0
    current_position = find_position('A')  # Start from 'A'

    for char in input_string:
        next_position = find_position(char)
        total_steps += steps_between(current_position, next_position)
        current_position = next_position

    return total_steps
```

---

### ✅ Final Code Example

```python
input_string = "OWL"
print("Total steps:", calculate_steps(input_string))
```

---

## 🧠 Simple Explanation

- You start at `'A'`.
- For each character in the input string:
  - Find its position in the matrix.
  - Count how many steps it takes to get there from your current position.
  - Add those steps to your total.
- Print the total number of steps.

## Example Walkthrough

Let's walk through the example input `"LANG27"` step by step — visually and clearly — using the matrix grid.

## 🧩 Matrix Layout

```
  0   1   2   3   4   5
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| A | B | C | D | E | F |  ← Row 0
| G | H | I | J | K | L |  ← Row 1
| M | N | O | P | Q | R |  ← Row 2
| S | T | U | V | W | X |  ← Row 3
| Y | Z | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |  ← Row 4
| 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 0 |  ← Row 5
```

Each cell is identified by `(row, column)`.

---

## 🎯 Input: `"LANG27"`

We start from `'A'` at position `(0, 0)` and move through each character in `"LANG27"`.

### 🔹 Step-by-Step Walkthrough

| From | To  | Position of To | Steps | Explanation      |
| ---- | --- | -------------- | ----- | ---------------- |
| A    | L   | (1, 5)         | 6     | Down 1 → Right 5 |
| L    | A   | (0, 0)         | 6     | Up 1 → Left 5    |
| A    | N   | (2, 1)         | 3     | Down 2 → Right 1 |
| N    | G   | (1, 0)         | 2     | Up 1 → Left 1    |
| G    | 2   | (4, 3)         | 6     | Down 3 → Right 3 |
| 2    | 7   | (5, 2)         | 2     | Down 1 → Left 1  |

---

### 🧮 Total Steps

```
6 (A→L) + 6 (L→A) + 3 (A→N) + 2 (N→G) + 6 (G→2) + 2 (2→7) = 25 steps
```

---

### 🗺️ Visual Path Summary

We can represent the path as a sequence of coordinates:

```
Start at A (0,0)
→ L (1,5)
→ A (0,0)
→ N (2,1)
→ G (1,0)
→ 2 (4,3)
→ 7 (5,2)
```

---

### 🧠 Intuitive Explanation

- You always move in straight lines — up/down/left/right.
- The number of steps is just how many rows and columns you need to cross.
- You never jump or move diagonally.
