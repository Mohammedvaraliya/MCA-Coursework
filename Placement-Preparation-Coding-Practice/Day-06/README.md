1. **Kth Largest Element in an Array**

## 01. Kth Largest Element in an Array

[LeetCode Problem URL](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/)

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the `kth` largest element in the array.

Note that it is the `kth` largest element in the sorted order, not the `kth` distinct element.

Can you solve it without sorting?

```bash
Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,1,5,6,4], k = 2
Output: 5
```

```bash
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6], k = 4
Output: 4
```

## 02. Container With Most Water

[LeetCode Problem URL](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)

You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `ith` line are (i, 0) and (`i, height[i]`).

Find two lines that together with the `x-axis` form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

```bash
Example 1:

Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
```

```bash
Example 2:

Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
```
